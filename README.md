# Pennyworth: Your Personal Wardrobe Assistant


This repostiory contains the code for a computer vision project CS231N: Convolutional Neural Networks @ Stanford University.

In this project, I built a clothing recommender system that first summarizes a piece of clothing based on physical qualities, such as color, type of clothing and then attempts to predict if the item is a good match for a user's previously liked items.

The data used is available at http://mmlab.ie.cuhk.edu.hk/projects/DeepFashion.html.
